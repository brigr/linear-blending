This project is just a hack inspired by reading a page in Szeliski's
book on Computer Vision applications. I read about a simple binary
transform that can take two color images and produce an output blended
image based on the two input images.

I was astounded by the idea that I sat down and wrote some OpenCV-based
code to resemble this idea. So, voila!

In this project, I have included some images that I obtained from Google
images. You can use these in order to experiment with the
linear-blending operator.
