This project is just a hack inspired by reading a page in Szeliski's
book on Computer Vision applications, Chap. 3. I read about a simple binary
transform that can take two color images and produce an output blended
image based on the two input images.

I was just astounded by the idea that I instantly sat down and wrote an OpenCV-based
implementation just to see how it works in practice. And, voila!

In this project, I have included some images that I obtained from Google
images. You can use these in order to experiment with the
linear-blending operator.
