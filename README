This is a straightforward implementation of a linear blending operation
between two images. The math was taught by a book of Szeliski on
computer vision.

In order to run the program, you will need OpenCV. In order to compile
the source code, you will need to issue "make" on the root directory
of the code...

When you are done with compiling, you can run the program against a set
of two identical images... For example, if you use a couple of images
from the example image set, you can run

./linear_blend bean1.jpg bean2.jpg

By varying the "alpha" parameter using the slider, you can achive a
certain level of image blending/morphing...
